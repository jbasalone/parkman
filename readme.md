### üõ†Ô∏è Command Arguments
Command arguments are optional settings that can be applied to each command to control its behavior. These settings allow for flexible command management, including permissions and usage restrictions. Here are the base command arguments you can use:

- `cooldown?`: Number of seconds to wait before the command can be used again. Defaults to no cooldown if not specified.
- `ownerOnly?`: If true, only the bot owner (as defined in the config) can use the command.
- `userWhitelist?`: Array of user IDs allowed to use the command. An empty array means no restrictions.
- `userBlacklist?`: Array of user IDs prohibited from using the command.
- `channelWhitelist?`: Array of channel IDs where the command can be used.
- `channelBlacklist?`: Array of channel IDs where the command cannot be used.
- `categoryWhitelist?`: Array of category IDs where the command can be used.
- `categoryBlacklist?`: Array of category IDs where the command cannot be used.
- `guildWhitelist?`: Array of guild IDs where the command can be used.
- `guildBlacklist?`: Array of guild IDs where the command cannot be used.
- `roleWhitelist?`: Array of role IDs allowed to use the command.
- `roleBlacklist?`: Array of role IDs prohibited from using the command.
- `optionalUserWhitelist?`: Array of user IDs optionally allowed to use the command.¬π
- `optionalChannelWhitelist?`: Array of channel IDs optionally allowed to use the command.¬π
- `optionalCategoryWhitelist?`: Array of category IDs optionally allowed to use the command.¬π
- `optionalGuildWhitelist?`: Array of guild IDs optionally allowed to use the command.¬π
- `optionalRoleWhitelist?`: Array of role IDs optionally allowed to use the command.¬π
- `nsfw?`: If true, the command can only be used in age-restricted (NSFW) channels.
- `disabled?`: If true, the command won't be registered and thus, will be unavailable for use.

¬π **Note on Optional Whitelists**:
When using optional whitelists, the command will be allowed to execute if any one of the optional whitelist conditions is met.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Example Usage:
```typescript
export = {
    cooldown: 10,
    ownerOnly: false,
    channelWhitelist: ["123456789012345678", "987654321098765432"]
    // ... other arguments
} as SlashCommandModule;
```

### ‚öîÔ∏è Slash Commands
Below is an example of a typical Slash Command module:

```typescript
interface SlashCommandModule {
  type: CommandTypes.SlashCommand;
  register: RegisterTypes;
  data: SlashCommandBuilder;
  execute: (...args: any[]) => Promise<void>;
  autocomplete?: (interaction: AutocompleteInteraction) => Promise<void>;
}
```

- `type: CommandTypes.Slashcommand`: Identifies the command as a slash command.
- `register: RegisterTypes`: Determines where the command should be registered. Use `.Guild` for server-specific commands or `.Global` for commands available across all servers where the bot is present.
- `data: SlashcommandBuilder`: Defines the command's details, including name, description, and options. You can also set permissions required to use the command here.
- `execute: (interaction: CommandInteraction) => Promise<void>`: The function that will be executed when the Slash Command is triggered.
- `autocomplete?: (interaction: AutocompleteInteraction) => Promise<void>`: A function for handling autocomplete interactions.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Example Slash Command:
Here's a practical example of a Slash Command:

```typescript
export = {
  type: CommandTypes.SlashCommand,
  register: RegisterTypes.Guild,
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
          .setName("ping")
          .setDescription("Replies with pong!")
          .setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.SendMessages),
  async execute(interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<void> {
    await interaction.reply({ content: "Pong" });
  }
} as SlashCommandModule;
```

### üîß Prefix/Ping/Message Commands
Prefix, Ping and Message Commands follow the same structure. Below is an example of a typical Prefix Command module:

```typescript
interface PrefixCommandModule {
  name: string;
  aliases?: string[];
  permissions?: string[];
  type: CommandTypes.PrefixCommand;
  execute: (message: Message) => Promise<void>;
}
```

- `name`: Specifies the unique name of the command.
- `aliases?`: An array of alternative names for the command. Use these to provide users with flexibility in invoking the command.
- `permissions?`: An array of required permissions for using the command. Define the necessary permissions to control access to the command.
- `type: CommandTypes.PrefixCommand`: Identifies the command as a prefix command (`.PingCommand` or `.MessageCommand`).
- `execute: (message: Message) => Promise<void>`: The function that will be executed when the Command is triggered.

#### üîß Example Prefix Command:
Here's a practical example of a Prefix Command:

```typescript
export = {
  name: "pong",
  aliases: ["poong"],
  type: CommandTypes.PrefixCommand,
  async execute(message: Message): Promise<void> {
    await message.reply("Ping!");
  }
} as PrefixCommandModule;
```

### üìë Context Menus
Context Menus in Discord bots allow users to interact with your bot through right-click context options in the Discord interface. Just like with other commands, standard command arguments can be applied to Context Menus for added flexibility and control. Here is a typical structure of a Context Menu module:

```typescript
interface ContextMenuCommandModule {
  type: CommandTypes.ContextMenu;
  register: RegisterTypes;
  data: ContextMenuCommandBuilder;
  execute: (interaction: ContextMenuCommandInteraction) => Promise<void>;
}
```
- `register: RegisterTypes`: Determines where the command should be registered. Use `.Guild` for server-specific commands or `.Global` for commands available across all servers where the bot is present.
- `type: CommandTypes.ContextMenu`: Identifies the command as a context menu.
- `data: ContextMenuCommandBuilder`: Defines the command's details, including name, description, and options. You can also set permissions required to use the command here.
- `execute: (interaction: ContextMenuCommandInteraction) => Promise<void>`: The function that will be executed when the Context Menu is triggered.

#### üìë Example Context Menu:
Here's a practical example of a Context Menu:

```typescript
export = {
  type: CommandTypes.ContextMenu,
  register: RegisterTypes.Guild,
  data: new ContextMenuCommandBuilder()
          .setName("Get Message ID")
          .setType(ApplicationCommandType.Message),
  async execute(interaction: ContextMenuCommandInteraction): Promise<void> {
    await interaction.reply({ content: `Message ID: ${interaction.targetId}` });
  }
} as ContextMenuCommandModule;
```

### üóÉÔ∏è Components
On Discord, Components are interactive elements like buttons, select menus, and modals that enhance user interaction. These can be implemented individually or grouped for complex interactions. Below is a typical structure of a Component module:

```typescript
interface ComponentModule {
  id?: string;
  group?: string;
  type: ComponentTypes;
  execute: (interaction: any) => Promise<void>;
}
```
- `id?`: Specifies a unique identifier (customId) for the component.
- `group?`: Defines the group to which the component belongs, aiding in group handling.
- `type: ComponentTypes`:  Identifies the type of the component (Button, SelectMenu, Modal).
- `execute: (interaction: any) => Promise<void>`: The function that will be executed when a user interacts with the component.

#### üóÉÔ∏è Example using ids:

**Creating and sending a button:**

This example creates a button with a specific id for distinct handling.

```typescript
const row: any = new ActionRowBuilder()
        .addComponents(
                new ButtonBuilder()
                        .setCustomId("deleteMessage")
                        .setLabel("Delete message")
                        .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Danger)
        );
await interaction.reply({ content: "Example", components: [row] });
```

**Handling the button interaction:**

The following code handles the interaction for the previously created button.
```typescript
export = {
  id: "deleteMessage",
  type: ComponentTypes.Button,
  async execute(interaction: ButtonInteraction): Promise<void> {
    await interaction.message.delete();
  }
} as ComponentModule;
```

#### üóÉÔ∏è Example using groups:

**Creating and sending grouped buttons:**

For buttons that are part of a group, the group name is prepended to the customId for easy identification and handling.
```typescript
const row: any = new ActionRowBuilder()
        .addComponents(
                new ButtonBuilder()
                        .setCustomId("group=subscription;confirm")
                        .setLabel("Click to confirm")
                        .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Success),
                new ButtonBuilder()
                        .setCustomId("group=subscription;cancel")
                        .setLabel("Click to cancel")
                        .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Secondary)
        );
await interaction.reply({ content: "Example", components: [row] });
```

**Handling grouped button interactions::**

This example shows how to handle interactions for buttons that are part of a group.
```typescript
export = {
  group: "subscription",
  type: ComponentTypes.Button,
  async execute(interaction: ButtonInteraction): Promise<void> {
    if (interaction.customId === "confirm") {
      await interaction.reply({ content: "Pressed confirm" });
    } else if (interaction.customId === "cancel") {
      await interaction.reply({ content: "Pressed cancel" });
    }
  }
} as ComponentModule;
```
This approach allows for more organized and scalable interaction handling, especially when dealing with multiple components grouped under a single category or function.

The examples provided for handling button interactions are also applicable to select menus and modals, which can be found in the code.

### üéâ Events
Below is an example of a typical Event module:

```typescript
interface EventModule {
  name: Events;
  once?: boolean;
  execute: (...args: any[]) => Promise<void>;
}
```
- `name: Events`: Specifies the type of event to handle, as defined in the `Events` enum.
- `once?`: If set to true, the event will be executed only once.
- `execute: (...args: any[]) => Promise<void>`: The function that will be executed when the specified event occurs.

#### üéâ Example Event:
Here's an example handling the `ClientReady` event:

```typescript
export = {
  name: Events.ClientReady,
  once: true,
  async execute(client: DiscordClient): Promise<void> {
    if (!client.user) return;

    client.user.setStatus(UserStatus.ONLINE);
    client.user.setActivity("Development", { type: ActivityType.Watching });
    Logger.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
  }
} as EventModule;
```

### üåà Colored Message Builder
The `ColoredMessageBuilder` class is designed to enhance the visual appeal of your Discord bot's messages. It allows for various text formatting options, including text color, background color, and styling. This feature can be particularly useful for highlighting important information or making responses more engaging.

#### üåà Example usage:

```typescript
const msg: string = new ColoredMessageBuilder()
        .add("Hello, ", Color.Red)
        .add("World!", Color.Blue, BackgroundColor.DarkBlue, Format.Underline)
        .addNewLine()
        .addRainbow("This is cool!", Format.Bold)
        .build();
```

Alternatively, for simpler text formatting needs, you can use the `colored` or `rainbow` functions:

```typescript
const simpleColoredMsg = colored("Simple Colored Message", Color.GREEN);
const simpleRainbowMsg = rainbow("Simple Rainbow Message");
```

### üî® Utility
The `formatTimestamp` function simplifies timestamp formatting for Discord, ensuring 
a user-friendly display of time in your bot's messages. All possible format styles are
supported and can be found in the source code.

#### üî® Example usage:
```typescript
const discordTimestamp = formatTimestamp(unixTimestamp, TimestampStyle.ShortDate);
```
**Output:** `01/23/2024`
